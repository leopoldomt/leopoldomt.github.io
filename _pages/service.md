*
*  This loop loops through a collection called `collection_name`
*  and sorts it by the front matter variable `date` and than filters
*  the collection with `reverse` in reverse order
*
*  To make it work you first have to assign the data to a new string
*  called `sorted`.
*
<ul>
    {% assign sorted = site.collection_name | sort: 'date' | reverse %}
    {% for item in sorted %}
    <li>{{ item.title }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul> -->
<!-- 
<div class="projects grid">

  {% assign sorted_projects = site.projects | sort: "importance" %}
  {% for project in sorted_projects %}
  <div class="grid-item">
    {% if project.redirect %}
