Hi there! I am an associate professor at the [Informatics Center (CIn)](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/) of the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br), where I lead the [Software Testing and Analysis Research](https://star.cin.ufpe.br/) group. I am also affiliated with the [Software Productivity Group](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/spg) and [CIn-Trust](https://trust.cin.ufpe.br/). Since May/2023, I am also head of graduate studies at our department. 

In 2022, I was a CAPES-Alexander von Humboldt Experienced Research Fellow at the [Chair of Software Engineering](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/) of [Universit√§t des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), working with [Sven Apel](https://www.se.cs.uni-saarland.de/apel/index.php) on variability analysis over time and space.

My research interests involve Software Engineering, with a focus on providing strong foundations for improving software quality and productivity. In particular, I have worked on software product lines and configurable systems, refactoring, formal methods, software testing, and mobile development.

I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Pernambuco (CIn-UFPE)](https://www.cin.ufpe.br) in 2014, under the supervision of [Paulo Borba](https://pauloborba.github.io) and [Rohit Gheyi](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~rohit/). During my PhD, I spent a winter term at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), working with [Krzysztof Czarnecki](https://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-intelligent-systems-engineering-lab/people-profiles/krzysztof-czarnecki). My MSc degree in Computer Science was also obtained at [CIn-UFPE](https://www.cin.ufpe.br) (2010), and prior to that I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [Polytechnic School of Pernambuco](http://poli.upe.br) (2007).
